# Frost-Heaving-and-Surfacing
Supplementary materials for the article include a fragment of code and a sample dataset.

In the first stage, to identify potentially dangerous areas of frost heaving and surfacing of the projected buried oil pipeline, 
we enriched the engineering and geological description of the soils. Enrichment is achieved by creating a family of parameters, 
that characterize the presence of water in two states and the interaction of the buried oil pipeline with soil layers. 
At the second stage, with the help of an enriched engineering and geological description, 
missed and erroneous soil parameters are restored by searching for similar patterns along the route of the oil pipeline. 
In the third stage, the selected areas of frost heaving and surfacing are ranked according to potential danger.
